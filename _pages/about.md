# About Me
* Hi! I am a second-year Ph.D. student at [EECS](https://eecs.engin.umich.edu/), [University of Michigan](https://umich.edu/), advised by [Prof. Qing Qu](https://qingqu.engin.umich.edu/). Before joining U-M, I received my undergraduate and master's degrees from the [Wuhan University](https://en.whu.edu.cn/), majoring in software engineering and computer science, respectively, advised by [Prof. Weiwei Liu](https://sites.google.com/site/weiweiliuhomepage/).

* My research interests lie in diffusion models and vision-language models, with a particular focus on model collapse and representation learning. I prefer to use mathematical tools to design algorithms and explain intriguing phenomena observed in experiments, providing insights for further algorithm development.
