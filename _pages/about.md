# About Me
* Hi! I am a first-year Ph.D. student at [EECS](https://eecs.engin.umich.edu/), [University of Michigan](https://umich.edu/), advised by [Prof. Qing Qu](https://qingqu.engin.umich.edu/). Before joining U-M, I received my undergraduate and master's degrees from the [Wuhan University](https://en.whu.edu.cn/), majoring in software engineering and computer science, respectively, advised by [Prof. Weiwei Liu](https://sites.google.com/site/weiweiliuhomepage/).

* My research interests broadly encompass topics in machine learning, algorithms, and their theory, including representation learning, adversarial robustness, domain shifts, and high-dimensional statistics. I prefer to use mathematical tools to design algorithms and explain intriguing phenomena observed in experiments, providing insights for further algorithm development.

* I am open to talking with anyone interested in my research or simply looking to chat about life in Ann Arbor ðŸ˜Š.
